Advisor Meeting No. 1
Wednesday: September 11th, 2019
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

A. Administrative Information:
-Emails
    -Whenever we have any questions, we should send emails to both advisors. 
    -Harri will send us an email by sometime tomorrow that has the data we need as well as click models
-Weekly submissions
    -The introduction should have already been submitted, but that’ll be done next week along side the related 
    works piece of writing
    - Submissions are due at Tuesday at midnight, since Martin gets up really early.

B. Clarification on Project:
    - Provided by Harri
    - PROBLEM: There is no real data to tell what people have observed, since we have no means of knowing about the 
    documents people observed and chose not to click.Thus, first must simulate what people observe. (Harri has a ranker 
    that he can provide, but we should also be able to find something pretty easily in the literature.)
    - Goal: Then, use the GANs to see if it can figure out the observance model. (Note: This may not work.)
    - We need to build a neural network that has two “parts”
              Part 1: Predicts what if a document is observed
              Part 2: From the observed documents, predicts what is clicked.       
    -Previous approaches
                (1) EM optimization
                (2) Randomization
                (3) The dual objective approach
                (4) The recent thesis: use a GANs-based loss
        *Our baselines are approaches 1-3.*

C. Notes on Grading:
    - Midterm presentation
          - We’re expected to have some completed experiments by then, even if they are just very basic ones.
    - Final paper/final presentation
           - Explain if the model works, and why/why not
           - Research questions are hard to come by, but good ones sound come up naturally during this process. 
           Before we do any experiments, we should have a clear idea of our research questions and know how our 
           experiments answer these questions. (This will also give us a good report.)

D. TODO:
    - Need to be able to generate clicks
    - Have the baselines done. (Everyone will work in pairs)
                -EM optimization: Traian and Orestis
                -Dual Objective: Thomas and Sietze
                -Randomization: Bella and Masoumeh 
    - Hand in the introduction and related works Tuesday night
            Would be nice to have everything done in Overleaf, where we share the link on the GitHub page? 
            (This is just a thought. This point we didn’t discuss in the meeting.)

Advisor Meeting No. 2
Wednesday: September 18th, 2019
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

A. Write Up Feedback
    -Introduction:
            - Need to include some overall context of ranking and search (why it's important in the first place)
            - Clearly defined what bias is in this context, and be more specific with the kinds of bias we are 
            focused on
            - At the end of introduction, include the motivation as to why we're interested in a GAN model.
            - Finally, conclude with a summary of what we're going to do in this report/paper
    -Related Works:
            - Mention click models as well as counterfactual learning to rank
            - Reference the original paper that introduced GAN architecture
    -Generally:
            - Use subsections if the introduction/related works gets so long that it feels unamangeable. Otherwise,
            subsections/subtitles aren't needed.

B. Processing our Datasets
    -Need to look into:
        -How long it takes us to process our raw data, since the Yahoo dataset (that we're currently working on) is
        pretty small. If we try to extend our pipeline to other datasets, then it needs to be very fast and efficent.
        -Feature normalization: only normalize features with respects to the query
            - Usually between interval of zero and one, where (x - min)/(max-min) easily works
            - Only the Websco dataset is normalized
            - For now, this is not a real concern; however, this will likely become a problem later on.
    -Harrie's code (for pre-processing)
            -Would give us a score with every document, where we only have to sort in descending order to get a ranking.
    -Should we have our generated clicks?
            -Inevitably, we will likely have to do this in some form, where we either just store our clicks or aggregate
            statistics from the clicks (e.g. the number of clicks that occured at position k)
            ***********************************************************************************************
            - WARNING: number of unique interactions should be the same across all the models we implement
            ***********************************************************************************************
    -TODO: things we should implement
            (1) If we don't use Harrie's code, then it's recommended to use an inverted ranking, which makes it easier 
            to calculate DCG.
            (2) If it takes too long for us to get clicks, we need to email Harrie. If needed, we can have an additional
            meeting.

C. Regression-based EM Algorithm:
    -Look int othe Unbaised LTR from Unbiased Feedback paper for how to simulate click logs (which we also have from the 
    DLA paper)
    -We can skip Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, and just use a neural network in place if we're too frustrated by 
    GBDTs. (This is just a suggestion. We can also stick to GBDTs.)

D. General Baselines
    -We've decided to stick to only showing the top 10 results across all models. (If we change this in one model, then we 
    have to change it in another.)
    
E. Action Items for next meeting:
    (1) Finish and implement regression-based EM model
    (2) DLA needs to output examination and probability (?)
    (3) Set up GAN and implement it
        Note. Follow one of the paper we were originally provided to discretize clicks.
    (4) Write Up: Methods is due next week
        - Be as concrete as possible, so Harrie can give us good feedback before we start
