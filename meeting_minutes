Advisor Meeting No. 1
Wednesday: September 11th, 2019
—————————————————————————————————

A. Administrative Information:
-Emails
    -Whenever we have any questions, we should send emails to both advisors. 
    -Harri will send us an email by sometime tomorrow that has the data we need as well as click models
-Weekly submissions
    -The introduction should have already been submitted, but that’ll be done next week along side the related 
    works piece of writing
    - Submissions are due at Tuesday at midnight, since Martin gets up really early.

B. Clarification on Project:
    - Provided by Harri
    - PROBLEM: There is no real data to tell what people have observed, since we have no means of knowing about the 
    documents people observed and chose not to click.Thus, first must simulate what people observe. (Harri has a ranker 
    that he can provide, but we should also be able to find something pretty easily in the literature.)
    - Goal: Then, use the GANs to see if it can figure out the observance model. (Note: This may not work.)
    - We need to build a neural network that has two “parts”
              Part 1: Predicts what if a document is observed
              Part 2: From the observed documents, predicts what is clicked.       
    -Previous approaches
                (1) EM optimization
                (2) Randomization
                (3) The dual objective approach
                (4) The recent thesis: use a GANs-based loss
        *Our baselines are approaches 1-3.*

C. Notes on Grading:
    - Midterm presentation
          - We’re expected to have some completed experiments by then, even if they are just very basic ones.
    - Final paper/final presentation
           - Explain if the model works, and why/why not
           - Research questions are hard to come by, but good ones sound come up naturally during this process. 
           Before we do any experiments, we should have a clear idea of our research questions and know how our 
           experiments answer these questions. (This will also give us a good report.)

D. TODO:
    - Need to be able to generate clicks
    - Have the baselines done. (Everyone will work in pairs)
                -EM optimization: Traian and Orestis
                -Dual Objective: Thomas and Sietze
                -Randomization: Bella and Masoumeh 
    - Hand in the introduction and related works Tuesday night
            Would be nice to have everything done in Overleaf, where we share the link on the GitHub page? 
            (This is just a thought. This point we didn’t discuss in the meeting.)
